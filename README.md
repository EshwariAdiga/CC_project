HR SERVICES SYSTEM - README

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple microservices as part of our HR Services System. It includes modular functionalities for student welfare, faculty leave, faculty exits, job portal services, and hostel management.

-----------------------------------
MICROSERVICES INTEGRATED:
-----------------------------------

1. **Student Welfare Microservice**
   - Handles counseling appointments, wellness programs, and resource management.
   - Flask-based, integrated via internal API routing.

2. **Faculty Leave Management Microservice**
   - Enables faculty to apply for leaves and view leave status.
   - Uses Flask, connected through RESTful endpoints.

3. **Faculty Exit and Feedback Microservice**
   - Records faculty resignations and collects feedback.
   - Modular Flask service communicating with other parts via API.

4. **Job Portal Microservice**
   - Allows candidates to apply for jobs, upload resumes, and track application status.
   - Flask microservice accessible through its own admin and user dashboards.

5. **Student Hostel Management Microservice** (Borrowed AM014_AM019_AM046_AM900 - Team Number 11)
   - Handles hostel registrations, room allocations, attendance, mess menu, and housekeeping data.
   - Built with Flask and SQLite, integrated into the main project structure.

Each microservice runs independently with its own Flask server, and all are integrated using **Docker Compose**, allowing the services to communicate seamlessly through internal networking.

GITHUB UPLOAD NOTE:
-----------------------------------

Due to the large number of files in the project, GitHub was not allowing us to upload the repository directly. To resolve this:

1. We **compressed the entire project into a ZIP file**  
2. Uploaded it to the repository  
3. It can be **downloaded and viewed using the “View Raw” option** on GitHub.

We thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing our work!
